# ‚ö° Velocity Demo - URL Shortener

**A real PHP app deployed in seconds with Velocity**

## What This Demonstrates

‚ùå **Before Velocity** (Traditional PHP deployment nightmare):
1. Manually configure nginx
2. Set up PHP-FPM 
3. Write custom deployment scripts
4. Handle environment variables
5. Set up error monitoring
6. Debug deployment issues
7. Spend hours on server configuration

‚úÖ **After Velocity** (Zero-pain deployment):
```bash
php velocity-standalone.php init    # Generate all configs
php velocity-standalone.php deploy  # Deploy with health checks
# Done! üéâ
```

## Features

- **URL Shortener API** - Create and redirect short URLs
- **Beautiful UI** - Clean, responsive interface  
- **Statistics** - Track click counts
- **Production Ready** - Deployed with Velocity configs

## Try It

1. **Run locally:**
   ```bash
   cd demo
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

2. **Deploy with Velocity:**
   ```bash
   php ../velocity-standalone.php init
   php ../velocity-standalone.php deploy
   ```

3. **Visit the app:**
   - Open http://localhost:8000
   - Create short URLs
   - See deployment simplicity

## The Story

Built by a 15-year-old developer who got tired of deployment complexity. 

**One tool. Zero dependencies. Infinite possibilities.**
